   <h2>Susan Sontag's <i>On Photography</i></h2>
    <p>
        In Susan Sontag’s essay, <em>In Plato’s Cave</em> from <em>On Photography</em>, she discusses how photography changes the way we view and experience reality. Images are powerful, yet they can also keep us from engaging with the world directly. Sontag points out that photography shapes what we see and how we remember. Photographs give us a sense of possession over the world, yet they are limited.
    </p>

    <p>
        This limitation becomes important especially when documenting major events. What gets shown or hidden depends purely on ideology, influencing the way the public understands those events. During the Korean War, no photographs showed the destruction caused by U.S. firepower. The war was framed as a “just struggle” against communism, so any images that would reveal the suffering of the Koreans at the hands of U.S. firepower were hidden from the public. In contrast, during the Vietnam War, many photographers captured raw moments of suffering. Hence, the war was defined by many as brutal, and those images helped fuel resistance to the war. Without those images, many people might not grasp the full horror of what happened. Sontag argues that photographs don’t simply show the truth, they show a version of truth that fits certain narratives.

        Sontag’s point on photography being limited introduced me to a brand new perspective. It made me reflect on my own relationship with capturing images and creating graphics. For me, capturing images feels like a way of holding onto those very moments and ideas. But as Sontag pointed out, every image is just one version of the truth. When I take a photo, I am making many choices. Carefully and thoroughly deciding what to include, what to crop out, and when to click the shutter. This means I am not just documenting life, I am shaping how it will be seen and remembered.

    <p>
        As I work through the projects from this semester, I’d like to think that each image I make will become part of a bigger story. Each assignment varies and might require different tools, but together, they will show how I see the world right now. I really like the idea of building a body of work, because it shows that every project can be connected to one another. One might focus on documenting reality, while another might focus on illustrations. When put together, they reveal more than individual skills, they also reveal a developing perspective and a sense of observation.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the current state of our world, photography and image making are even more significant. We live in an era where photography is essential, with billions of images captured daily. We are surrounded by pictures all the time, social media feeds, news reports, and advertisements. That also makes me wonder, what kind of images would I want to create? I would want my work to grab people’s attention, to offer another way of looking and make them reflect. I want my work to mirror my perspectives of the world.
    </p>

    <p>
        Capturing images is more than just saving memories. On a deeper level, it’s about observing and interpreting the world and sharing that with others. Sontag’s views shaped my understanding of the power of photography, because it can both reveal and distort. As I create my projects this semester, I hope to make good use of that ability. Not just to show what is in front of me, but also to express how I perceive the world and what I think matters.

    <h2>Nesrine Malik's <i>“With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster”</i></h2>
<p>
    As technology continues to progress in our society, artificial intelligence is becoming more advanced and involved in our daily lives. More and more people are using AI to create content, and the internet has begun to be filled with what some people refer to as “AI slop.” At first glance, AI generated content can be entertaining or even impressive. However, as the amount of AI generated content grows, it is starting to become overwhelming, and I can’t help but feel uneasy about this. While scrolling through social media platforms, I sometimes might find it difficult to distinguish what is real and what is generated by AI. 
</p>

<p>
    What worries me the most is how this affects different generations. Children’s media literacy skills are still developing, yet they are exposed to AI generated videos and images as a form of entertainment almost on a daily basis. Meanwhile, older people who are less familiar with technology may not have the skills to critically judge what they see online. I often think about my own family and how easily they could be misled by AI generated content, especially when it is presented in a convincing way. The thought of people we care about being unable to distinguish reality from AI slop makes me feel anxious and worried about the future of our society.
</p>

<p>
    The “dead internet theory” adds another layer to my unease. It suggests that much of what we interact with online might not be made by real people at all. When I first heard about the dead internet theory, where there are thousands of AI generated images on Facebook, and the replies all sound robotic and stiff, it makes me feel like we are living in a simulation, a world where reality is being replaced by endless loops of AI generated content. It is important to have critical thinking and media literacy, not just for children and the elderly, but for everyone. 
</p>

<p>
    As mentioned in the reading, there was a trend recently of creating images using the Studio Ghibli art style. It saddens me how many people are relying on AI to generate art content, when there are artists out there who take commissions. AI generated art to me feels soulless, as they all mimic the same style with no special characteristics. The expressions in AI art often look stiff and emotionless, lacking the feelings that real human artists would put into their work. The worst part about this is that AI generated art takes away opportunities from real artists.
</p>

<p>
    Reflecting on AI slop makes me realize the importance of critical thinking and media literacy, not just for younger children or older people, but for myself as well. I constantly remind myself to be mindful about the types of content I consume online and think about how AI content might influence the way I view things. Living in an era where real and fake things blend together so easily can be confusing, but it also reminds me to stay alert and pay attention to how I use technology and interact with others.

<h2><i>Motherhood in Crisis</i> by Laurence Ivil, Alicia Prager, and Saidu Bah</h2>
<p>
    <i>Motherhood in Crisis</i> shows how the combination of text, illustration, and photography can create a powerful and personal look at motherhood experiences in Sierra Leone. This series depicts the serious risks and struggles that women face in a country where pregnancy can be life-threatening and healthcare systems are often limited. By using visual storytelling, the series goes beyond just reporting facts. It shows the emotional and social challenges that women face, making their experiences feel more real and easier to understand. The stories not only show what happens physically, but also the pressures women deal with from their families and society. This makes the reading experience resonate better with the readers.
</p>

<p>
    One story that really stood out to me was about Heela, a teenage schoolgirl whose life changed dramatically when she became pregnant at a young age. I think the illustrations in her story help show what she went through in a more emotional and personal way. Instead of just showing the events, the drawings let readers see and feel her experiences on a deeper level. The artists use colors and symbols to show emotions such as sadness, fear, and hope, which are feelings that are harder to express with only words or photos. The illustrations give a sense of Heela’s thoughts and emotions, helping readers understand her story more fully. They also make the story feel more alive and relatable, so readers can connect with her as a person rather than just a subject in a report.
</p>

<p>
    The illustrations feel very different from the photographs in the story. The photos show real places, giving readers a sense of the environment and the reality of life in Sierra Leone. Meanwhile, the drawings focus on Heela’s feelings and personal experiences. By combining real photos with illustrations, the story feels both real and emotional. This mix helps readers see the reality of her life while also connecting to what it might feel like to be in her situation.
</p>

<p>
    Illustration also helps protect these women’s privacy. Some of the women might feel shame or face danger if their faces were shown. Drawing them instead of just using photos lets the stories be told in a safer way while still getting the points across and helping readers connect with the women. Illustrations also let the artists show moments or feelings that a camera might miss, such as memories and thoughts. Compared to text alone, illustrations make the story more visual and engaging. Compared to photography alone, they give a softer and reflective tone that encourages readers to think and feel rather than just watching.
</p>

<p>
    The combination of text, drawings, and photographs makes Heela’s story and the series as a whole more powerful and layered. It helps readers understand not just what happened, but what it felt like for these women to live through these experiences. Illustrations bring the human side of the stories to life, making it easier to connect with these women and understand their struggles. They show why empathy is so important in storytelling and make the series both moving and meaningful. By combining different forms of media, <i>Motherhood in Crisis</i> creates a fuller impact on the audience, leaving readers with both understanding and reflection.
