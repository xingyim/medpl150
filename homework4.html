    <p>
    For this photomontage, I wanted to show how pollution starts from something small and grows into something much bigger. The top half of my image shows a clean city at sunset with a person dropping a single crushed can. It seems like nothing serious, just one piece of trash. But the bottom half reveals a huge landfill filled with garbage, showing what happens when everyone thinks that way. I wanted people to realize that every small action matters. When one person litters, it doesn’t seem like a big deal—but when millions do it, the world becomes covered in waste. The contrast between the calm city and the overwhelming landfill represents how we often ignore the problem because it’s hidden from our daily lives. The image is meant to make viewers feel uncomfortable and think about how our habits affect the planet. The idea that one tiny act of carelessness can lead to such large-scale damage was really important for me to express. I want people to see that change starts with small choices—picking up trash, recycling, and caring about what we leave behind. Even though the piece looks simple, it’s about how quickly things can build up when we don’t take responsibility. It’s a reminder that the environment won’t fix itself, and that the future depends on how we choose to act right now.

    In this photomontage, I wanted to show how artificial intelligence can affect the human mind and creativity. The robotic hands above the open brain represent how technology is starting to control or shape the way we think. The background of gears shows how mechanical and repetitive AI can be, while the lightning between the hands and brain shows a kind of transfer of power or energy. I wanted to capture the idea that technology isn’t just helping us anymore—it’s starting to take over parts of our imagination and thought process. The man’s expression looks empty, which to me shows how people can lose a sense of themselves when they rely too much on AI. It’s like our creativity is being influenced or replaced by machines that can “think” faster but don’t actually feel or imagine. I wanted the viewer to question how much of our ideas are really our own and how much are shaped by what we see through technology. This piece reflects my own mixed feelings about AI—it’s fasc
