        For this image, both the choices made in cropping and tonal adjustments were my intention 
        to change the viewerâ€™s perception of a city scene. The original image captures a wider view, 
        which included extra details at the edges that pulled away from the central focus of the 
        street view. By cropping, I attempted to tighten the perspective, drawing more attention to 
        the street and the horizon line where the cars cluster. The crop makes the city feel narrower 
        and busier. Instead of feeling open, the scene becomes more compressed, reflecting a sense of 
        being submerged in the city life rather than just observing from afar.

        I wanted to achieve a cinematic look for this image, and I did so by shifting the midtones 
        down to give the image a bit more texture and a cinematic quality. I also deepened the 
        shadows in the trees and cars, making the lower part of the image feel heavier. In contrast, 
        the highlights in the sky and the buildings have a glow, symbolizing hope and ambition. By 
        having darkness and brightness coexist in the same image, it creates tension and balance.

        After putting these choices together, they turned a casual street snapshot into something more 
        symbolic and cinematic, demonstrating a focused perspective about city life. The crop creates 
        a dense feeling, while the tonal range builds tension between light and dark. The city is 
        presented as an emotional landscape, vibrant and structured, yet also overwhelming with little 
        room to breathe due to how busy everyday life is.
