    <img src="image1.jpeg" alt="Composition Photo 1">

    <div class="text-block">
        <p>
            For this image, the original lighting gave me a feeling of nostalgia, and that was exactly the feeling I wanted to achieve. I changed the tonal range so that the image would feel more artistic and emotional rather than just a clear picture of the city. By softening the shadows and adding warmer tones to the buildings, I was able to give the picture a softer and more nostalgic mood.
        </p>

        <p>
            By adjusting the shadows, I made the image less bright so it looks less harsh, making it feel almost like an old memory instead of the present day. I also adjusted the tones of the sky by adding a hint of blue. The warmer tones of the buildings go well together with the cooler tones in the sky, creating a contrast, but also a balance that feels calm. The clash of tones also suggests how the city can hold both warmth and distance at the same time.
        </p> 

        <p>
            My goal was to make the photo feel like a memory of walking through the city in a late afternoon, where the sunlight can change how everything looks. By adjusting the tonal range, the view becomes less about the details of the buildings, and more about the feelings they are able to give off.
        </p> 

        <p>
            These adjustments change the meaning of the image to something more personal and emotional. It shows how the city can be seen not only for its physical details, but also as a place for reflections and memories. The final result feels somewhat dreamlike, inviting the viewer to connect with it in a deeper way.
