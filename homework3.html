    I captured a series of photos that depict a city life. The first set with the moving cars captures the movements and energy within the city. The deep depth of field shows the city in full detail, cars driving by and tall buildings in the back. It feels almost a little overwhelming to look at, giving off a feeling that the city is always busy and never slows down. However, the shallow depth of field changes that feeling. By blurring the background, it is as if the noise of the city fades away for a moment, letting us focus on a smaller piece of it. The photoshopped blur also creates a new focus on objects that weren't shown before, allowing us to focus on one thing at a time.

    The second part of the homework focuses on images that shift the overall view to quieter spaces. The “before” photos are darker and heavier. Meanwhile the “after” photos feel lighter, showing how light can bring out details that were always there but are easy to miss. The image of the flowers especially shows this change, turning from something dim into something bright and lively. As for the image of the tree, I made the lighting warmer to give off the feeling of the warm afternoon sunlight. This warmth changes the mood completely, it makes the scene feel calmer and softer as if time slowed down in that moment.

    In this photomontage, I wanted to show how artificial intelligence can affect the human mind and creativity. The robotic hands above the open skull and exposed brain represent how technology is starting to control and shape the way we think. The background full of gears shows how stiff and repetitive AI can be, while the electricity between the hands and brain shows a kind of transfer of energy from AI to us. I wanted to emphasize the idea that technology and AI aren’t just helping us anymore, it is starting to take over parts of our imagination and thought process too. Nowadays, some people rely way too much on AI. The man’s expression looks empty and soulless, which to me represents how people can lose a sense of themselves when they rely too much on AI. It’s almost like our creativity is being replaced by machines and codes that can “think” faster but don’t actually feel or imagine like actual humans do. I also want to question how much of our ideas are actually our own and how much are shaped by what we see through technology. I have mixed feelings about AI. On one hand, it is fascinating and helpful, but on the other hand, it is also a little scary to think about how much control it might have over us in the future, especially now that AI is starting to take over certain jobs too. While AI can inspire us, it shouldn’t replace the human part of creativity that makes our thoughts and actions unique.
