    <h1>Xingyi Ma</h1>
    <p>
       My name is Xingyi Ma, and I am a nursing major. Even though I study science and healthcare, I have always been interested in art and creativity from a young age. I used to enjoy drawing a lot, but as I grew older, I slowly parted from this hobby since I saw no potential in myself when it came to art. However, I decided to do a concentrated study in media now that I am in college because I want to explore more about art and creativity. This is also an opportunity for me to reconnect with my younger self. Different types of media make me think about the world in different ways. I enjoy paying attention to details that might be overlooked, because I think ordinary things can be beautiful and meaningful if we look closely. I hope to be able to create art that is expressive and conveys different emotions. I am also interested in writing and storytelling. I enjoy different forms of storytelling, especially interactive narratives like story-based games. They allow me to explore different themes and think creatively. Even though I am not a professional artist, these creative practices are important to me because they help me understand myself and the world around me. Creativity is not just for artists, it is something that everyone can explore, no matter their major or career path. By combining my interest in nursing with my creative side, I hope to share a unique perspective and continue learning about both art and life.
