    <h1>Xingyi Ma</h1>

    <p>
       I am Xingyi Ma, and I am a nursing major. Even though I study science and healthcare, I am drawn to art and media because they allow me to reconnect with my younger self and explore the world creatively. I used to enjoy drawing a lot, but as I grew older, I slowly parted from this hobby since I saw no potential in myself when it came to art. However, I decided to do a concentrated study in media now that I am in college because I want to explore more about art and creativity. This is also a chance to experiment with different forms of media, such as interactive narratives and digital illustrations.
    </p>

    <p>
     Different types of media make me think about the world in different ways. I enjoy paying attention to details that might be overlooked, because I think ordinary things can be meaningful if we look closely. I hope to be able to create art that is expressive and conveys different emotions. I am also interested in writing and storytelling. I enjoy different forms of storytelling, especially interactive narratives like story-based games. These let me explore different themes and experiment with how stories can be told. Even though I am not a professional artist, these creative practices are important to me because they help me understand myself and the world around me. Creativity is not just for artists, it is something that everyone can explore, no matter their major or career path. By combining my interest in nursing with my creative side, I hope to share a unique perspective and continue learning about both art and life.
